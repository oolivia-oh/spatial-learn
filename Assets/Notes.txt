Generate lessons based on tables and spatial information.
Seating layout in classroom.
Room layout in school and how teachers relate to that.
I then need data on each of the pieces of data which can be tested to see how well I know it.
Seen, last seen, got correct. Give a retrievability score for each piece of data and add to it based on how cold that info is.
Really I need catagories.
I also need a score for each of the connections between data.
Given a first name can you tell me the last name? First and last name linked strongly.
All data in a table is heavily linked?


Focus on seating plan first as this is the most important.
take in x, y
detect gaps in seating plan
